# 1.0.6 (2024-09-04)

### Bug Fixes

- Escaping text to avoid REDCap Security Scan errors
- Refactor Citation HTML to be AJAX loaded
- Fix issue with report_id not being submitted to the export script

# 1.0.5 (2024-09-04)

### Features

- Honor REDCap user permissions. The export will now honor REDCap user permissions just like the normal export. If a user does not export rights to fields included in the report, those fields will be excluded from the export.
- Include all citations: The export window will now display all citations that should be cited based on project settings/usage.

### Bug Fixes

- Comma separated values in the report will now be properly escaped. This will prevent the export from breaking when a comma is included in a field value.
- Escape value in searching. The searching uses a regular expression to find the value in the report. This regular expression was not properly escaping special characters. This has been fixed.
- Erroneous removal of ending parenthesis in the report. The report was removing the ending parenthesis from values when it shouldn't have been. This has been fixed.

# 1.0.4 (2024-08-03)
